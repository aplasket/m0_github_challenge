# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
open the directory you want the new repo in, `git clone SSH`, `cd` into that directory, then `code .` and make changes in VS Code. Go back to terminal `git add` and `git commit` and then `git push`
